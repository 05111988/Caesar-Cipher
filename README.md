A simple Python implementation of the classic Caesar Cipher algorithm, allowing you to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet. This project was built as part of Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Code (Day 8).

🚀 Features
✅ Encrypt text with a specified shift

✅ Decrypt text back to original form

✅ Handles wrap-around (e.g., 'z' to 'a')

✅ Keeps spaces and symbols unchanged

✅ Easy to follow and beginner-friendly

🧠 Concepts Used
String manipulation

For loops and conditional logic

Function creation

User input handling

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3

Platform: Jupyter Notebook

Welcome to Caesar Cipher!
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
> encode
Type your message:
> hello world
Type the shift number:
> 5
Here's the encoded result: mjqqt btwqi# Caesar-Cipher
This project is a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique where each letter in a message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. Built as part of Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Code (Day 8), this notebook offers both encryption and decryption modes.
