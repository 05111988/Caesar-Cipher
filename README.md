# Caesar-Cipher
This project is a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique where each letter in a message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. Built as part of Angela Yuâ€™s 100 Days of Code (Day 8), this notebook offers both encryption and decryption modes.
